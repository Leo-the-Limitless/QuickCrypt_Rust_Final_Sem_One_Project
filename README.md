# **QuickCrypt (File Encryption Tool)** üîê
This is a Rust-based application that I and my teammate worked together on. It is intended for securely encrypting and decrypting files using AES-256 encryption in CBC mode. The application allows users to select files, enter or generate encryption keys and initialization vectors (IVs). As a bonus feature, it supports both light mode and dark mode themes.

This tool is ideal for securely protecting files, whether they are sensitive documents, images, or other forms of data.

## üöÄ Features
- **File Encryption & Decryption** with AES-256 CBC mode.
- **Random Key & IV Generation** for added security.
- **Dark Mode Toggle** to switch between light and dark themes.
- **Clipboard Support** for copying keys and IVs.
